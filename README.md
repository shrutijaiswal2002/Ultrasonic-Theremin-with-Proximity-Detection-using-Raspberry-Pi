# Ultrasonic-Theremin-with-Proximity-Detection-using-Raspberry-Pi
 This project successfully emulates a theremin by using an ultrasonic distance sensor and a buzzer, creating sound  based on proximity. The Raspberry Pi processes the distance values and maps them to MIDI tones, making it  possible to play tones without touching the instrument.
